This thesis presents the development and evaluation of an AI-powered chatbot designed 
to assist students in academic and career guidance by accurately retrieving information 
from complex documents. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, the 
system integrates advanced components such as MPNet embeddings, OpenChat 
generation, and vector databases to improve response accuracy and semantic 
understanding. The project involved extensive data cleaning, chunking, and retrieval 
configuration. Evaluation metrics, including MRR@3, MAP, Recall@3, ROUGE-L, and 
Cosine Similarity, confirmed the chatbotâ€™s ability to provide relevant, document
grounded answers. Compared to general models like ChatGPT and DeepSeek, the chatbot 
uniquely succeeded in retrieving institution-specific data, such as tuition fees, proving its 
effectiveness for academic applications. The study also highlights technical constraints 
and offers future directions for system enhancement.
