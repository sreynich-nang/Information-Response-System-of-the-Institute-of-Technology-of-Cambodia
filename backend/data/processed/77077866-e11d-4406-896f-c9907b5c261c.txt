PART I: GENERAL DOCUMENT
1 INTRODUCTION
Since its establishment in 1964, the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC) has received greater
recognition for its successes and achievements in serving the country through human resources
development, institutional capacity building and working intensely on the economic and infrastructure
development of Cambodia. ITC, for more than four decades, has established a link between the French
and English-speaking networks in the region and in the world. With its numerous collaborators,
administrators, students, faculty staffs and alumni, this institution offers a unique multilateral context for
an exchange of views with ministries, local authorities, NGOs, the private sectors and partner institutions.
ITC has a mission to train students with high-quality education in the fields of engineering, sciences and
technologies and to develop innovative technology transfer. Students are provided with a strong scientific
base and technical know‐how and skills which allow their integration and evolution in the labor market.
Based on the decision of the annual board meeting, the future orientation of ITC is to expand the
engineering education area and develop research platforms in order to sustain the development of the
country. This requires strengthening the basic scientific knowledge, developing research programs in
connection with the private sectors and national and international stakeholders, supporting communities,
fostering economic development through entrepreneurship programs, and helping our graduate students
integrating the global economy. Ultimately, it is important for ITC to keep its own identity of a multilingual
institution maintaining and expanding a network with French and English-speaking universities, to provide
an education that motivates teaching staffs and students, stimulates creativities and inspires future
ambitions, and to develop an internationally recognized research in adequacy with the needs of the
society.
The vision of Institute has been set out based on the Rectangular Strategy Phase 4 of the Royal
Government of the 6th legislative term of the National Assembly “to improve work, equity and
effectiveness, to form a basis towards achievement of Cambodia’s Vision for 2050”.
2 PERSPECTIVE AND STRATEGIES
Perspectives
To become a leading institution with efficiency and excellence offering the academic, research,
science, technology, innovation and engineering in technology transfer to the community.
ITC has adopted the new Strategic Plan (2021-2030) based on the Rectangular Strategy (Phase IV) of
the government together with the National Strategic Development Plan (2019-2023). This Strategic Plan
will provide directions for effective implementation of the Action Plans and address the challenges in
order to improve the engineering education quality in a competitive environment.
Two main objectives of ITC Strategic Plan (2021-2030) to be reached by 2030 are as follows:
1- To train 17200 students with high qualification towards the Cambodia Vision 2030
2- To implement 175 applied projects with technology transfer and start-up for harmonization and
development towards the Cambodia Vision 2030
The vision of Institute has been set out based on the Rectangular Strategy Phase 4 of the Royal: Government of the 6th legislative term of the National Assembly “to improve work, equity and
Strategy of ITC
ITC has developed 5 main strategies to meet the 10-year objectives as follows:
1- Establish and apply academic program responding to the market needs with national and
international recognition
2- Develop human resources and modernize technology for good governance, management and
financial affairs
3- Develop physical infrastructure and modernize the laboratories
4- Establish the investment projects and applied research projects targeting to start-up and
technology transfer
5- Modernize the data information system for dissemination of activities and results to the
communities

Promotion of Soft Skills
Soft skill is an essential course which promotes personal attributions that sit outside the professional qualifications and work experience. Soft skills will be mainstreamed into technician and engineering program at ITC for building students’ soft capacities. Among the other skills, Team Work is one of the principle skills to be considered. 2 Trainings on Teamwork will be given to ITC students annually.
Teamwork involves building relationships and working with other people using a number of important skills and habits:
• Working cooperatively
• Contributing to groups with ideas, suggestions, and effort
• Communication (both giving and receiving)
• Sense of responsibility
• Healthy respect for different opinions, customs, and individual preferences
• Ability to participate in group decision-making
5 CHALLENGES
• Managing capacity building projects and collaborative projects requires more time and effort which need more capable administrative staffs to help.
• Limited number of classrooms compared to total enrolled students.
• Low number of available scholarships and research grants for research students, making it difficult to promote research activities and to attract outstanding students to work and study at ITC.
• Research facilities such as laboratories are not advance enough for research link with industries for product development to meet market needs.
• Promote our prototypes to commercialization
6 RECEIVING CAPACITY OF ITC

Department of Geo-resources and Geotechnical Engineering was established in late 2011 to response for urgent needs for management and development of the resource’s sustainability of minerals and petroleum in Cambodia. According to Prokas No. 726 of Ministry of Education Youth and Sports, Department of Geo-resources and Geotechnical Engineering has upgraded to Faculty of Geo-resources and Geotechnical Engineering, consisting of two departments, Department of Geo-resources and Geotechnical
Engineering, and Department of Petroleum Engineering. However, due to narrow of job market in the field of petroleum, the Faculty of Geo-resources and Geotechnical Engineering has been implementing only one engineering program – Program of Geo-resources and Geotechnical Engineering with multidisciplinary fields, such as mining, petroleum, and geotechnical engineering.
In response to the current urgent need of human resources for engineers and associate degrees in geotechnical engineering, which is experiencing significant growth, there is a rising demand for skilled professionals in the field. The construction and real estate sectors are expanding, contributing to the increased demand. Over the past decade (2009 -2019), Cambodia has seen a 7.1% GDP growth, with 2% increase in construction and real estate, as reported by World Bank, resulting in the creation
of 220,000 jobs. In 2022, Cambodia’s GDP grew by about 5.5% and an estimated growth rate of 6.6% is expected in 2023. Geotechnical engineers and technicians play a crucial role not only in construction companies but also in mining industries, supporting activities such as soil investigation, tunnelling, retaining wall, surface, and underground mining.
Establishing an associate degree program in geotechnical engineering will help prepare individuals for these specific roles and ensure they have the relevant knowledge and skills required by the industry. Moreover, the establishment of the associate degree program aligns with the institution's vision and supports national development goals, such as the Rectangular Strategy Phase 4 of the Royal Government. By providing quality education and producing skilled graduates in geotechnical engineering,
the program contributes to the growth of employment, equity, and efficiency, which are vital for the overall development of Cambodia. The faculty aims to enhance educational opportunities for students interested in geotechnical engineering by offering a structured curriculum that covers foundational principles and practical skills in the field. This program can serve as a stepping stone for those who choose to pursue further education or enter the workforce directly after completing the
associate degree. Therefore, the faculty proposes the establishment of an 'Associate Degree in Geotechnical Engineering'."

Detail of proposed modification of Transport and Infrastructure Engineering program of Faculty of Civil Engineering
1. BACKGROUND
Transport sector plays a very important role for the overall economic growth of a society. It integrates mobility of people and goods at both domestic and international levels (e.g., transport by roads, railway, maritime, river, and air transport networks). The continuous population growth and their daily activities pose significant challenges to the development of transport systems and infrastructures in many countries, including Cambodia. Particularly, the number of qualified people with
specialization in the transport and infrastructure related fields remains quite limited to respond to Cambodia's development. This is due to the fact that there is very little educational training program in these fields. Certain existing courses related to buildings and public works are often included in civil engineering program.
2. NAME OF THIS PROGRAM
- Name in French: Génie des Transports et des Infrastructures
- Name in English: Transport and Infrastructure Engineering
- Name in Khmer: ដេប៉ា តឺម៉ាង់់ ់់ដេពដោសល្យដេដ្ឋា រចនាសមព ័ន្ធ ន្ិងេឹកជញ្ជ
ូ ន្
3. OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROGRAM
This program was launched in 2022, for the first time in Cambodia, to educate more specialists and qualified engineers in respond to needed human resources in the fields of transport and infrastructure engineering. It allows students to acquire specific technical skills such as the study on road traffic, the design of construction plans, planning, construction techniques, maintenance and repair of infrastructure, management of goods flows, etc. After their studies, students can work either in
design offices, on construction sites, or in administration responsible for different tasks related to transport and logistics and with different responsibilities. They also have the opportunity to continue their studies at higher degrees, including master and doctoral degrees.
4. PROPOSED UPDATED CURRICULUM OF THIS PROGRAM
In response to the current job markets and digital society transformation, the curriculum of this program “Transport and Infrastructure Engineering” should be updated accordingly. We propose to slightly modify 3 courses as shown in Table 1. Table 2 shows the full curriculum of Transport and Infrastructure Engineering program at Institute of Technology of Cambodia, after this update.

Detail of modification of Mechanical Engineering Program
1. BACKGROUND
The Mechanical Engineering program at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC) boasts a rich history, evolving alongside Cambodia's growing need for skilled professionals in mechanization and automation across various sectors. Originally offered within a combined program with Industrial Engineering, the program became independent in 2012. This separation allowed for a more specialized Mechanical Engineering curriculum, preparing graduates for the anticipated advancement of technologies that
would drive Cambodia's industrial progress.
Presently, with Cambodia's rapid industrialization and commitment to economic diversification, we see the urgent need to further revise and modernize the curriculum. This revision aims to equip graduates with the skills and knowledge to address the challenges and opportunities presented by Industry 4.0, the rise of Artificial Intelligence, and the ever-evolving global landscape.
Cambodia's national focus on industrial growth has fueled a surging demand for skilled mechanical engineers. This trend directly aligns with the country's development goals outlined in the Industrial Development Policy 2015-2025 (IDP 2025), which targets transforming Cambodia into a "upper-middle- income" nation by 2030, heavily reliant on a robust industrial sector. (https://cdc.gov.kh/wp- content/uploads/2022/04/IDP-English.pdf)
One of the key strategies is mobilizing and attracting foreign investments as well as private domestic investments in prioritized sectors which include manufacturing and support industries. The key sectors like garments, automotive parts, and electronics, all of which heavily rely on mechanical engineers for:
• Designing and developing production processes and machinery
• Implementing, and maintaining mechanical systems
• Optimizing production lines for efficiency and quality control
Integrating sustainable energy solutions
• Supervising and managing teams of technicians.
Furthermore, mechanical engineers play a critical role in Cambodia's construction sector, acting as the core force behind MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) works in all new and existing construction projects. Their expertise is essential for designing, installing, and maintaining of:
• Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
• Plumbing systems, Fire protection systems
• Elevators and escalators
• Building automation systems.
According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), the garment, footwear, and travel goods industry alone, which contributes significantly to Cambodia's GDP, employed over 750,000 individuals in 2022 (https://www.khmersme.gov.kh/en/news/cambodias-garment-footwear-travel-goods-exports-up- 40-pct-in-h1-of-2022/). This vast industry, along with the growing automotive and electronics sectors, necessitates a substantial pool of qualified mechanical engineers.
Furthermore, a report by the World Bank estimates that Cambodia's manufacturing sector will continue to grow at a rate of 7-8% annually for the next five (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS?locations=KH). This projected growth further underscores the critical role mechanical engineers will play in driving this expansion and ensuring Cambodia's continued industrial development. years

Detail of modification of Industrial Engineering Program
1. BACKGROUND
The Industrial Engineering program at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia (ITC) has a rich history, evolving alongside Cambodia's growing industrial sector. Originally offered within a combined Industrial and Mechanical Engineering program, the program became independent in 2012. This separation aimed to streamline the curriculum, allowing for the inclusion of more specialized industrial engineering subjects to better prepare graduates for the anticipated rise in demand for industrial
engineers.
The early years of the independent program were marked by a pragmatic approach to curriculum design.

Furthermore, the construction sector, experiencing significant growth in Cambodia, also presents opportunities for industrial engineers to contribute their expertise in:
• Project planning and management
• Cost analysis and optimization
• Supply chain management
• Facility design and layout
According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), the garment, footwear, and travel goods industry alone, a significant contributor to Cambodia's GDP, employed over 750,000 individuals in 2022
(https://cleanclothes.org/resources/publications/factsheets/cambodia-factsheet-february-2015.pdf). This
vast industry, along with the growing automotive, electronics, and construction sectors, necessitates a substantial pool of qualified industrial engineers.
A report by the World Bank estimates Cambodia's manufacturing sector to grow at 7-8% annually for the next five years (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NV.IND.MANF.ZS?locations=KH). This projected growth, coupled with the ongoing development in various sectors, emphasizes the critical role industrial engineers will play in enhancing Cambodia's industrial efficiency, boosting productivity, and ensuring its sustainable economic development.
The Industrial Engineering program at ITC is committed to providing graduates with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in this dynamic environment. By continuously modernizing the curriculum, we aim to equip them to become the driving force behind Cambodia's industrial success story.

Detail of proposed modification of Water and Environmental Engineering (WEE)
1. BACKGROUND
Water and Environmental Engineering Program (WEE) is established in 2018 under the faculty of hydrology and water resources engineering (GRU) responds to the needs of engineers and expert on WASH sector. WEE program was updated in 2022 to adopt green education strategies and Lab Base Education and Problem-Based Learning method for the maximum benefit of 4C’s education and 21st- century skills. There were 94 students graduated in 2023, 80% of them go the job and own a business while another 20%
continue master degree in Cambodia and in other countries. However, we found that the students face difficulty to follow the specialized course of Unit Operations and Processes for Environmental Engineering due to the lack of fundamental course of engineering which is a basic of unit operation course. Therefore, we propose to modify some courses to improve the student competency base. There are two aspects shall be improved as following:
Improving the competency of wastewater engineering on unit operation
Improve soft-skills through Skills for Employability
- Integrated Problem-Based Learning method and improve the computing program which is really important for the 21st century working environment.
▪ Human Resources:
- In academic year 2023-2024, Faculty of Hydrology and Water Resources Engineering has 23 (F:7) full-time lecturers possess Master and PhD degree. PhD fulltime: 15 (F:5), PhD Part-time: 3 (F:0), Master fulltime: 8 (F:2), Master Part-time: 5 (F:1).
- The WEE program has a professional program coordinator to review and develop the program based on job market needs
- Highly competent of lecturers with long working experience which keep improving the course content and teaching method
▪ Facility:
Main facilities currently available and particularly support the WRI program:
- Hydrology and Hydraulics Lab
- Water Quality Lab
- Plumbing lab
HydroMet and Disaster Management Lab
- Water Environment Lab
- Coastal & Wetland Environmental Lab
Khmer Earth Observation Lab
Through the HEIP2, the faculty proposed to uupgrade facilities for the implementation of PBL such as Equipment for Water and Wastewater, and Equipment for Plumbing Experiment and Testing.
▪ Program Marketing: boost the visualization of the program by
- Organized students’ monthly seminar with invited speaker from alumni of WEE
Invite companies to join career fair and join the thesis defend day
- Develop attractive brochures and other promotion materials for both online and offline campaign
- Promote to high school students through the students networking and promotion mission in the province
- Expand the collaboration with stakeholders to promote internships, research collaboration, training seminar and other practical skills.
2. PROPOSE MODIFICATION OF CURRICULUM OF WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING (WEE)
For the upcoming academic year, the WEE program requested to remove 2 courses by replacing 2 new courses which are Skills for Employability, and Fundamental for Environmental Engineering. The others 2 courses are modified the name. The total number of credits is proposed to change from 97.5 credits to 97 credits while the total number of hours remains same.

Detail of proposed separated Chemical Engineering and Food Science Technology from the third year and modify some major courses under Faculty of Chemical and Food Engineering
1. BACKGROUND
The Food Science Technology program is one of the programs under the faculty of Chemical and Food Engineering, established in 1986. This Food Engineering program is a combination of food science, technology, and engineering with the core focus on problem-solving, process optimization, Food industrial design, Food Processing Technology, Food product development, valorization of by-products to reduce food waste, applied science and technology in food manufacturing, and integration of digital
solutions in the processes (process optimization) to improve traceability, quality, safety, and efficiency in the production, and distribution system of Food. This program is highly relevant to the local needs and national development goals in Cambodia.
Chemical Engineering is a 5-year engineering program established in 2017 under the Faculty of Chemical and Food Engineering. This program is a combination of industrial process, bio-process, environment, chemistry, and engineering. Chemical engineers could be responsible for chemical production, synthesis, industrial development and design, and purification of materials that are associated with fuels biodiesel, and lubricants (petroleum), pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fertilizers, synthetic
fibers, microelectronic components, plastics, and food products. Chemical engineers are involved in minimizing and reducing the use of energy to make these products in safe and sustainable ways and lower the impact on the environment. This Chemical Engineering program shapes the students to different specializations of chemical engineering such as agro-chemical process and analysis engineering, pharmaceutical and cosmetic engineering, application of advanced organic chemistry, etc.) that could
support to applied chemistry for industrial engineering, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic engineering, etc.
Two existing programs, the Chemical Engineering and Food Science Technology Program separated from the fourth year, so the students can study for their specialization for only 1 year and a half. Faculty plans to modify and improve the program to reach the national and regional standard (e.g AUN-QA) by 2029, so it is necessary to separate the program of Chemical Engineering and Food Science Technology from the third year. It means that the students will select the program (chemical Engineering or
Food Science Technology) from their foundation year. After separating the program, the faculty will rearrange the program by integrating 21st-century skills, and project-based learning including the entrepreneurship course to create a business mindset and bring the products to markets, and the program also shapes the students to specialization by each semester.
2. PROPOSE MODIFICATION OF THE CURRICULUM OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
For the upcoming academic year, the program of chemical engineering and Food Science Technology requested to separate from Year 3 as following

Detail of modification of Industrial Engineering and Supply Chain Management Program
1. BACKGROUND
Our international programs, Robotics and Automation Engineering, and Industrial Engineering and Supply Chain Management have started in 2021. The programs are under partnership with ECAM LaSalle in Lyon, France. 12, 12, and 15 Cambodian students have enrolled in the first, the second and the third batches respectively. All Cambodian students received scholarships ranging from 30% to 80% of tuition fee, and received scholarships covering flight tickets and accommodation for exchange to study 1
semester in Lyon. There are exchanges of 36 French students to study in our programs as well.
Qualified and self-funded students have an opportunity to study another year in Lyon to get ECAM Engineer’s degree which is equivalent to master’s degree. Our programs in all campuses have signed double degree agreements at master’s degree level with Chiangmai university, Kasetsart university in 2023. It is a great opportunity for those who want to pursue master’s degree. And also, every year, there are going to be total number of 15 to 20 student exchange between ITC and the two universities.
The program was designed to response the needs of the Kingdom of Cambodia’s industrial sector, which is specifically aligned with the latest policies by the royal government of Cambodia. Therefore, it is opted to regularly improve the curriculum accordingly.
Cambodia Digital Government Policy (2022-2035):
The Cambodia Digital Government Policy outlines strategic goals and actions to enhance digital infrastructure and services. While it primarily focuses on government operations, its principles can extend to the manufacturing sector.
Strategic Goal 1 emphasizes building digital infrastructure, including connectivity and security. A robust digital backbone benefits all sectors, including manufacturing1
Strategic Goal 2 aims to create digital governance and public services. Implementing digital systems in manufacturing can streamline processes, improve supply chains, and enhance efficiency1.
Industry 4.0 Opportunities:
A report by the UN Development Programme highlights opportunities for Cambodia’s manufacturing industries to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Policies that encourage this adoption can drive digital transformation in manufacturing2.

Detail of proposal for Master Program of Architectural Engineering
1. BACKGROUND
According to survey questionnaire among 170 graduated students and final year students, about 70% of them expressed their support and are interested in studying the master's degree of architecture by strongly arguing that the master program can really improve their knowledge of conceptual theory, sustainability and building information modelling (BIM) and train their skill in career practices,
Among 15 national and international companies, the survey showed that they strongly support for ITC to open a master 's degree in architecture and there are 8 companies which have mostly one or two architects holding master and 2 companies which have one architect holding Ph. D. degree. The other companies employed only architects holding bachelor's degrees. This explain that the availability of master architects is very limited, and today’s demand is so high that ITC should take this
opportunity to launch this master program.
Besides the survey of demand of architects holding master's degree, 7 companies did support by stating their interest and support to ITC for opening master's degree in architectural engineering. All support letters are attached.
In opening this master program, ITC have worked closely with professors specialized in Architectural Engineering from the University of Liège and University Libre of Brussel. In COMBOd’IA, Professor Piere LECLERCQ and Prof. Samia BEN RAJEB accept 3 PhD students to learn and do research for the field in order to form human resources, established a virtual bureau of architecture and improve the curriculum Bachelor of Architecture Engineering and propose a new Master of Architectural Engineering
this year.

Detail of proposal for revising the name of a research unit (from MSS to MBE)
The Materials Science and Structure Research Unit focuses on research and innovation trends in engineering and construction materials, especially low-carbon impact materials and lightweight structures. This includes geotechnical engineering, underground structures, structural engineering, minerals, polymers, ceramics, and alloys to address specific needs in Cambodia. The research unit also pays attention to the field of Architectural Engineering, particularly in studies related to affordable
housing.
While the activities conducted in the Architectural Engineering field are already part of MSS, the unit's name is not reflected in this field. Therefore, a modification is proposed. After discussions among our team and partners, the new name "Materials and Built Environment" (MBE) has been suggested. The purpose of this modification is to integrate relevant research fields such as architectural engineering, transportation, logistics, and others into this research unit. Using the right
terminology is crucial to raise awareness among the public and students, encouraging them to apply in this field, and promoting collaboration with professional stakeholders.
Currently, there are 3 senior researchers, 3 full-time researchers, and 2 potential lecturer researchers working in this field. Additionally, there are 5 ongoing research projects. The research themes in architectural engineering include but are not limited to:
Integrated and instrumented design
• Bioclimatic construction
• Sustainable design
• Building Information Modeling/Management (BIM)
• Collaborative design
• Urbanization principles
The activities and management structure that have been conducted previously remain the same. The intention of this revision is to emphasize that relevant research fields can be accommodated within this unit for public awareness and to promote research collaboration.
